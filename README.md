# Weather
On a dashboard with inputs I will have a modul for weather.  If you look for th city, you should be given current and future conditions fo that city. The city should be added to search history
when you view current weather conditions for that city.You should be given the name, date, and icon of: weather conditions, temperature ,humidity and wind speed. 
If you look in the future conditions you should see a 5 day forecast with the date, icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
When I click on city in the search history then you again should receive current and future conditions.
